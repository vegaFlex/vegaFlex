# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## About Me  
Aspiring Software Developer with a strong foundation in **Python & Django**, passionate about building robust and scalable web applications. Recently completed my training at **SoftUni** and actively working on real-world projects to sharpen my skills.  

💡 My goal is to transition into a professional developer role, leveraging my hands-on experience in **Django, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and full-stack web development**. I have tackled various challenges, including setting up **e-commerce platforms, integrating Stripe payments, optimizing database structures, and deploying applications on Azure**.  

🖥️ I also have experience with **JavaScript at a fundamental level**, allowing me to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

## Hosted Applications  
Here are my hosted applications:  
- 🌐 **[EventHub](https://eventhub-fta3fsb7dgctfagd.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/bg/)** – A multifunctional event management platform.  
- 📚 **[BookZone](https://bookzone-bg-ckd0b9b3abdvfncx.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/)** – An online bookstore with advanced user interaction features.  

I am also actively working on several other projects that are still in development and not yet hosted. Stay tuned for updates!
